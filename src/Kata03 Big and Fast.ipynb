One way to attack the password file is to generate all possible cleartext passwords, applying the password hash to each in turn and checking to see if the result matches the password you’re trying to crack. If the hashes match, then the string you used to generate the hash is the original password (or at least, it’s as good as the original password as far as logging in is concerned). In our particular system, passwords can be up to 16 characters long, and there are 96 possible characters at each position. If it takes 1mS to generate the password hash, is this a viable approach to attacking a password?"
